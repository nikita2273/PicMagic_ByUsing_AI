## Features
- Users can input a text prompt that describes the desired image, and the system generates an image based on this prompt.
- Provides clear messages for any issues (e.g., invalid input, API errors). This helps users understand and resolve issues quickly.
- The project uses dotenv to securely manage API keys and other environment variables, ensuring that sensitive information is protected.
- The backend is designed to handle multiple requests simultaneously, making it scalable for use in larger applications or by multiple users at the same time.
- The project includes efforts to optimize image generation times and reduce latency, ensuring a faster and smoother user experience.
- Allows users to download the generated image to their device.

## Technology Used
- React.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- OpenAI API

## Enhancements
- Users can save their generated images in a personal gallery for future reference.
- Allow users to mark images as favorites for quick access later.
- Allow users to generate multiple variations of an image from a single prompt.
- Offer different styles or themes (e.g., cartoon, realistic) to apply to generated images.
- Allow users to crop, rotate, or adjust brightness and contrast of generated images.
- Enable users to leave comments or feedback on shared images.

## Project status
- The core backend functionality is being developed using Node.js with Express for handling API requests. The project is set up to interact with OpenAI's API to generate images based on user prompts.
- Common errors such as invalid API keys and billing issues have been identified and are being addressed in the code to ensure robust error handling.
- Environment variables are managed using dotenv, allowing for secure storage of sensitive information like API keys.

## To run the project 
# Backend
- # npm run dev
- Runs the backend server in development mode.
